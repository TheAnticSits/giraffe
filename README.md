# giraffe
Just a practice repository for experimentation.
Using it for online classes that just need essentially a scratch board for working with Java skills.
Made it through the Giraffe academy lessons on Java.
Using it for Giraffe academy lessons on html and css.
Also using it for if I white board a problem to check to see if it works.
Basically just a playground.
